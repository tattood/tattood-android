** Missing
  + Search Page (Works on clicking from tag/username but there is no dedicated search bar)
  + Upload (Tag, Privacy)
** Bug
  + See-More page shows empty entries
  + tattoos should be saved using tattoo id not using loop index. (index might cause collision)
  + CameraFragment.java gives warning: attempt to use a camera after disconnect()
    Most probably onPause()/onResume() related
  + Currently there is a bug in Tattoo interactions. If listener is null, OnClick gets called in+
    OnListFragmentInteractionListener. Otherwise, it gets called in TatooRecyclerViewAdapter.
    I've used this to distinguish between calls from Discovery Page and Profile Page;
    but it is definitely a bug.
  + Visual Interface looks horrible
