** Missing
  + Search Page (Works on clicking from tag/username but there is no dedicated search bar)
  + Upload (Tag, Privacy)
** Bug [4/7]
  + CameraFragment gives warning: attempt to use a camera after disconnect()
    Most probably onPause()/onResume() related
  + Visual Interface looks horrible
  + [ ] Recursive clicks should lead back to Discovery page (From tattoo? user? all?)
  + [ ] Change Upload button to FAB
  + [ ] Change Camera button to FAB
  + [ ] Currently, all requests to tattoo-update deletes all tags of a tattoo and reinserts. This,
    doesn't cause much problem since number of tags are quite small, but there might be a better
    way of doing this.
